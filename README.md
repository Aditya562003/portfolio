**NOTE:** If temporarily unavailable, view the website at [rish-space.herokuapp.com](https://rish-space.herokuapp.com/)

The website might not work until 10.09.20 because I'm trying to point to `https://`. I've followed [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@successengineer/how-to-setup-heroku-with-godaddy-d8e936d10849) but I don't know if it will work. Since DNS records take 24-48 hours to propogate, I just have to wait!

This is [my personal corner on the web](http://rish.space). I quite like the domain name; conveys exactly what it is.
